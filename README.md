---

This repository contains an implementation of MLOps workflows using Prefect, an open-source workflow automation platform. The aim of this project is to demonstrate best practices for managing machine learning workflows in a production environment, including data preprocessing, model training, deployment, and monitoring.

## Overview

Prefect MLOps provides a streamlined framework for orchestrating end-to-end machine learning pipelines. It integrates seamlessly with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, allowing users to define and execute complex workflows with ease.

## Features

- **Workflow Automation**: Define and automate machine learning pipelines using Python-based workflows.
- **Flexible Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with various data sources, machine learning frameworks, and deployment platforms.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to workflows and pipeline components using version control systems like Git.
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Monitor pipeline performance and receive alerts for anomalies or failures.
- **Scalability**: Scale workflows horizontally and vertically to accommodate large datasets and computational resources.
- **Containerization**: Containerize workflows and models for portability and reproducibility across environments.


## Getting Started

To get started with Prefect MLOps, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seunboy1/Prefect-mlops.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running:
